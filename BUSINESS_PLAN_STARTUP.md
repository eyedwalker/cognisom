## 11. Multi-Stage Simulation Roadmap (Digital Human Trajectory)

Although this document focuses on **Year 0-1**, cognisom is explicitly designed to grow into a **full human digital cognisom** over the next 5-10 years. The startup phase establishes the *first rung* of a multi-stage simulation ladder:

1. **Single Cell Archetypes**  
   - **Scope (Year 0-1)**: Build and validate a high-fidelity mechanistic model for 1-2 *foundational cell types* involved in prostate biology and immunity:  
     - Prostate luminal epithelial cell  
     - Stromal fibroblast (support/ECM)  
     - CD8 T cell and NK cell (immune surveillance)  
   - **Functionality**:  
     - DNA→RNA→protein, metabolism, cell cycle  
     - Receptor signaling, cytokine responses  
     - Basic epigenetic state variables (methylation/acetylation indices)  
   - **Deliverables (Year 1)**:  
     - Validated single-cell models on GPU (10-100× speedup vs CPU)  
     - Open-source reference implementations + tests  
   - **Cost (Year 1 portion)**: **$150K-300K** (grants + credits + founder time)

2. **Cell-Type Library for Prostate & Tumor Microenvironment**  
   - **Scope (late Year 1 → Year 2)**: Expand to a **minimal basis set of cell types** required to reconstruct realistic prostate tissue and tumor microenvironments:  
     - Luminal, basal, neuroendocrine epithelial cells  
     - Stromal fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells  
     - Endothelial cells (vasculature), pericytes  
     - Immune cells (T cells, NK, macrophages, dendritic)  
   - **Strategy**:  
     - Reuse the same **GPU kernels and codebase**; parameterize cell types via configuration, not forks  
     - Establish a **common cell interface** so all types plug into the same engine  
   - **Goal**: Enough diversity to **assemble a digital prostate region** (normal + cancer + immune) as the first organ-level testbed.  
   - **Timing**: Begins in **Q3-Q4 of Year 1**, continues into Year 2 (see 3-5 Year Plan).  
   - **Incremental Cost (late Year 1)**: Included in Year 1 budget (contract comp bio + GPU time).

3. **Systematic Human Cell Atlas on Silicon**  
   - **Long-Term Vision**: Over 5-10 years, build a **library of mechanistic cell models** covering:  
     - Major parenchymal cells for each organ (hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, neurons, etc.)  
     - Key stromal, immune, endothelial, and stem cell types  
     - Representative microbiome cell types and communities  
   - **Design Principle**: Each new cell type is a **parameterization** and extension of the same underlying engine, so all models are compatible and can be co-simulated.  
   - **Outcome**: A reusable **"cell codebase"** capable of expressing the diversity of the human body.

4. **From Cells to Tissue Patches (Prostate First)**  
   - **First Milestone (Years 1-2)**:  
     - Assemble 10K-100K cell simulations representing prostate tissue regions with:  
       - Normal glandular tissue  
       - In situ lesions  
       - Invasive cancer  
       - Immune infiltration and exclusion  
       - Local vasculature and lymphatics  
   - **Research Capabilities**:  
     - Test mutations (PTEN, TP53, AR)  
     - Immune evasion strategies  
     - Hormone manipulation (ADT) and drugs  
     - Spatial heterogeneity and microenvironmental niches  
   - **Feasibility**: Achievable with **2-8 modern NVIDIA GPUs** (A100/H100 class) and grants outlined in Year 1.

5. **Organ Blueprints & Reusable Profiles**  
   - **Concept**: For each organ, define a **blueprint**:  
     - Cell type mixture and spatial arrangement  
     - Typical gradients (oxygen, nutrients, hormones)  
     - Mechanical/structural constraints  
   - **Approach**:  
     - Start with prostate; then define blueprints for liver, lung, brain, bone marrow, etc.  
     - Save **"organ profiles"** (config + code) that can be re-instantiated on any compatible GPU cluster.  
   - **Hardware Strategy**: Reuse the **same physical GPUs**, swapping configurations rather than owning hardware per organ.  
   - **Timeline**: Organ blueprint work begins **late Year 1** in concept and moves into serious implementation in **Years 2-3**.

6. **Organ Systems → Full-Body Digital Cognisom**  
   - **System-Level Integration (Years 3-5)**:  
     - Couple organ blueprints into **organ systems** (cardiovascular, immune, endocrine, nervous) using reduced-order and surrogate models.  
     - Maintain detailed simulations only where needed (e.g., tumor regions), with coarser models elsewhere.  
   - **Full Human Digital Cognisom (Years 5-10)**:  
     - Combine organ systems into a **coherent, interacting digital human** capable of:  
       - Supporting disease progression scenarios  
       - Testing mutations, viruses, drugs, and hormone regimes  
       - Modeling microbiome interactions, feedback loops, epigenetics, and immune education (thymus/T-cell training)  
   - **Hardware**:  
     - Early full-body prototypes feasible with **100-1,000 high-memory GPUs** plus aggressive use of ML surrogates and multi-resolution modeling (detailed in the 3-5 Year Plan).  

7. **Biological Richness & Communication (Design Requirements)**  
   - The roadmap explicitly includes:  
     - **Cell-cell communication**: paracrine, endocrine, juxtacrine, exosomes, nanotubes  
     - **Microbiome**: representative bacterial communities and host-microbe signaling  
     - **Epigenetics**: methylation, histone states, and their impact on gene expression dynamics  
     - **Immune education**: thymic selection, TCR repertoire formation, self vs non-self discrimination  
     - **Receptor logic**: how cellular receptors integrate signals to decide proliferation, apoptosis, migration, or differentiation  
   - These requirements drive the **initial single-cell design choices in Year 1**, so that future expansion does not require re-architecting the core engine.

### Year 0-1 Role in the 10-Year Vision

In practical business terms, **Year 0-1 is about building the first few rungs of a very tall ladder**:
- Prove that a single mechanistic cell model can run efficiently on GPUs.  
- Demonstrate that multiple distinct cell types (normal, cancer, immune) can share the same engine.  
- Show that a small prostate tissue patch (10K cells) can reproduce known biology and generate publishable insights.  
- Use that success to win **larger grants and partnerships** that fund the organ, organ-system, and full-body phases.

The detailed timelines, budgets, and hardware scaling for **organ systems** and a **full human digital cognisom** are laid out in the companion document: **[3-5 Year Business Plan](BUSINESS_PLAN_3_5_YEAR.md)**.

## Conclusion

The startup phase focuses on **validation and traction** for both platforms:

### **cognisom**: Prove technical feasibility + secure non-dilutive funding
- Open-source strategy builds community
- Grants provide runway without dilution
- Academic validation enables commercial opportunities

### **eyentell**: Achieve product-market fit + early revenue
- SaaS model provides predictable revenue
- Privacy-first positioning differentiates
- Professional services market is underserved

### **Combined Strategy**: De-risk through diversification
- Multiple revenue streams
- Non-dilutive funding (grants, credits)
- Complementary technologies
- Shared infrastructure reduces costs

**By end of Year 1**: Profitable or break-even, clear path to scale, strong technical and customer validation.
