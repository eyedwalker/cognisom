## 📱 Social Media Strategy

### LinkedIn Post Format

**Structure:**
```
[Compelling Hook - 1-2 sentences]

[Brief context - 2-3 sentences]

[Key insight or statistic]

[Link to full article]

[Hashtags]
```

**Example for Article 1:**
```
600,000 Americans die from cancer every year. We have immunotherapy that should work. But it fails 80-90% of the time in solid tumors.

Why? Because we're flying blind. We don't understand what's happening inside the tumor microenvironment. We test treatments through trial-and-error, wasting months of patients' lives and hundreds of thousands of dollars.

There's a better way: simulate the tumor before treating it. Test therapies virtually. Predict outcomes.

```

### Twitter/X Thread Strategy

For each article, create a 10-15 tweet thread:

**Thread Structure:**
1. Hook tweet (with article link)
2. Problem statement
3. Key statistics (2-3 tweets)
4. Solution overview (2-3 tweets)
5. Impact/benefits (2-3 tweets)
6. Call to action
7. Final tweet with link + hashtags

**Example Thread Starter:**
```
🧵 Why do 90% of cancer immunotherapies fail in solid tumors?

A thread on the $100B question—and how computational biology might finally answer it.
